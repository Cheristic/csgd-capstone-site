## Where do we go from here?
**Sprint 1a is coming to a close** and the time is nigh to decide upon a game structure!! Our core souping mechanic has a lot of potential, but simultaneously has a lot of drawbacks, meaning whatever structure we decide to place it in must draw out as much of that potential as possible.

Our team will vote on what structure we like. This list is not exhaustive, but here are the options:

***

### 1. Hand-crafted Levels
> **DESCRIPTION:** 
> - Player will navigate through pre-made levels. 
 - Could have rooms, large continuous spaces, branching paths, or a mix. 
- Enemies can be manually placed or have some form of variance. 
- Boss fights. 
- Good for story/lore. 

> **PROS:**
> - Vertical slice very doable since level, quantity can vary.
- Not infinitely replayable, so don't need to worry as much about enemies/abilities getting stale. 

> **CONS:**
> - *Very* level design and art intensive.
- A singular experience means it better be a really good one.

> **SPECIFIC IDEAS**:
> - Markus suggested a bonfire system where you can sit down and craft a build. The soup system is for short-term mechanics, forcing players to use what's in their environment to survive and giving rise to varied forms of play, so the bonfire system would be for long-term mechanics (pot type, seasoning, weapon).

***

### 2. Rogue-like
> **DESCRIPTION:** 
> - Player moves through rooms arranged using procedural generation.
- Probably levels/floors a la Enter the Gungeon.
- Enemies will be randomly placed, so pot abilities will vary a lot.
- Would probably use some cheat procedural generation system like Spelunky does.

> **PROS:**
> - Plays well with the "foraging for whatever you can find"-system since you literally cannot know.
- Builds will vary between runs and be more personalized.

> **CONS:**
> - Procedural generation :( but Markus said this was his speciality. 
- Scope issue: Infinitely replayable and personalized experience means lots of enemies/abilities must be made.
- Kinda similar to Moore and Arjun's game.
- Lots of art.

> **SPECIFIC IDEAS**:
> - Use the 1. Hand-crafted levels design, but add a lot of variance. 
- Classmate Nat suggested a system like the game Patch Quest, where it has Metroidvania-style connected levels but each one randomly selects from a set of specific enemies and rooms (although it feels identical to other rogue-likes :shrug:)

***

### 3. Online multiplayer rounds
(not really sneaky fellas anymore by this point)
> **DESCRIPTION:** 
> - 2-4 players traverse a shared space, foraging for soup ingredients to defeat each other in soup combat.
- Short 1~ minute mini-battle royale rounds.

> **PROS:**
> - Doesn't require as much variety since variety arises from player-to-player interactions.
- Not much art.
- Environments and ingredients can be entirely distinct (Castle, Hell's kitchen).
- Pre-existing prototype so we know in theory it's fun.

> **CONS:**
> - NETCODE
- NETCODE
- NETCODE YIKES!!!! - But Ethan has experience and classmate Regis's group is making online multiplayer too.
- Not much lore, nor fun enemy design.
- Might end up as Sneaky Fellas, but with a different mechanic slapped on top for the sake of it.

> **SPECIFIC IDEAS**:
> - Could connect via Steam accounts like Regis is doing.

***

### 4. Vampire Survivors-like
> **DESCRIPTION:** 
> - Walk around and auto-target enemies using your abilities.
- Potential idea: Enemies drop ingredients, walk over to collect, during every periodic upgrade period, choose ingredients to combine to access new abilities.

> **PROS:**
> - Opportunity to focus almost exclusively on interesting ability mechanics
- Environments are just different levels to choose so they can be entirely distinct (Castle, Hell's kitchen).

> **CONS:**
> - Must change the genre up in an interesting way
